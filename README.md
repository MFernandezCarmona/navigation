ROS Navigation Stack for ILIAD 
==============================


A 2D navigation stack that takes in information from odometry, sensor
streams, and a goal pose and outputs safe velocity commands that are sent
to a mobile base.

This stack is forked from  [Strands Navigation stack](https://github.com/strands-project/navigation). It has been merged with kinetic branch for compatibility.
